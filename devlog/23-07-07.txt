Progress:

Implemented CMake build system to enhance code management, making it clearer and simpler.
Redesigned the entire system, reducing coupling and improving security.
Separated the implementation of CornInfo and CornState into separate .cpp and .hpp files.
Improved the hash function, resulting in a threefold speed improvement.
Optimized the algorithm for finding next states, enhancing readability and reducing code length.

Next Steps:

Separate the implementation of CornSolver into .cpp and .hpp files.
Update the documentation to include installation instructions.
Add an option to CornState for reading from files.
Implement the "interleaved meet in the middle" technique to avoid excessive search.
Continue refining and completing the algorithm.
