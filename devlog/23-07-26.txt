Progress:

Implemented CornOperation to represent basic operations
Enabled solution display in a more readable format
Renamed CornSolver to CornExplorer, added a more suitable CornSolver
Simplified main function

Next Steps:

Add different solution printing options
Add a logger
Support color initialization/printing instead of number
Support step by step guidance (as a output option)
Maybe use Template meta programming to process a little further from the initial state
